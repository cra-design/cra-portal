<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <p>The elections listed below can be filed using an online Web form. Other elections can be sent to us by uploading a completed <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms.html">PDF form</a> for the election you want to file.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Election or revocation of an election to change a GST/HST fiscal year (GST70 or RC7270)</h2>
    <p>Use this form to file an election to change your GST/HST fiscal year, or to revoke a previously filed election.</p>
    <p>If you are an individual or a trust, you can make your fiscal year end something other than a calendar year end if you have chosen for income tax purposes to use a fiscal period that is not the same as your tax year for one or more of your businesses (or a partnership of which you are a member).</p>
    <p>If you are not an individual or trust, you can change your GST/HST fiscal year to be either: (i) the same as your tax year for income purposes, or, (ii) December 31st.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="dt70">Effective date</h3>
    <p>The effective date must be the first day of the new fiscal period. For example, if your new GST/HST fiscal year end is June 30 (06-30) and you want the election to be effective for 2018, then the effective date must be July 1, 2018.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="e71">Notification of accounting periods (GST71 or RC7271)</h2>
    <p>Use this form if your accounting periods vary in length throughout your fiscal year, or if your quarter-end and month-end dates do not end on the last day of a calendar month. Your accounting periods have to meet our guidelines for fiscal quarters and months.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="fq71">Fiscal quarters</h3>
    <p>There are four fiscal quarters in each fiscal year. The first fiscal quarter in a fiscal year starts on the first day of that fiscal year, and the last fiscal quarter ends on the last day of that fiscal year. Each fiscal quarter cannot be longer than 119 days and, except for the first and last quarters of the fiscal year, each fiscal quarter cannot be shorter than 84 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="m71">Fiscal months</h3>
    <p>The first fiscal month in each fiscal quarter starts on the first day of the fiscal quarter, and the last fiscal month in each fiscal quarter ends on the last day of that fiscal quarter. Each fiscal month cannot be longer than 35 days and, except for the first and last month of a fiscal quarter, each fiscal month cannot be shorter than 28 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2 id="GST74">Election and revocation of an election to use the quick method of accounting (GST74)</h2>
    <p>Use this form to start or stop using the quick method of accounting.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3>Electing to use the quick method</h3>
    <p>When electing to use the quick method of accounting, the effective date has to be the first day of a GST/HST reporting period. If you had previously elected to use the quick method and had revoked that election, you have to wait at least one year from the date the revocation became effective before you can elect to use the quick method again.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3>When and how can you revoke the election?</h3>
    <p>You can revoke the election only after your quick method election has been in effect for at least one year. Generally, you have to revoke the election by the due date of the GST/HST return for the last reporting period in which you wish to use the quick method.</p>
    <p>For more information, see Guide RC4058, Quick Method of Accounting for GST/HST.</p>

<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="t20">Threshold amount</h3>
    <p>You will need the following information to determine your threshold amount:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Total taxable sales and revenue for your immediately preceding fiscal year. Do not include amounts collected as GST/HST or provincial sales tax.</li>
        <li>
            The total of your taxable sales and revenue that was derived from:
            <ul>
                <li>goodwill;</li>
                <li>financial services;</li>
                <li>sales of capital real property;</li>
                <li>zero-rated exports; and</li>
                <li>supplies made outside Canada.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Threshold amount = ((Total taxable sales and revenue - Total taxable sales and revenue derived from the items listed above) / Total number of days in the fiscal year) x 365</p>
    <p>If you have divisions or associates, complete the above calculation for each division or associate. The total threshold amount equals the sum of all the threshold amounts for each associate, as well as the threshold amount for the account filing the election.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="dt20">Effective date</h3>
    <p>The effective date must be the first day of your fiscal year.</p>
    <p>Your election will not be accepted if you have already filed GST/HST returns for the fiscal period. For example, if you file your election on March 1, 2021 with an effective date of January 1, 2021, and you have already filed your January 2021 GST/HST return, we will not accept your election.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3>Due date for filing your election</h3>
    <p>If you are electing to change from quarterly to annual filing, file your election no later than three months after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the election is to take effect.</p>
    <p>If you are a new registrant, make an election to change your reporting period on or before the effective date of your GST/HST registration when the election is to take effect on that day.</p>
    <p>In all other cases, file your election no later than two months after the day the election is to take effect.</p>
