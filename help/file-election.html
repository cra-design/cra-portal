  </table>
</div>
<p>Charities may use any of the reporting period options, regardless of their taxable supplies.</p>
<h4 id="t20">Threshold amount</h4>
<p>You will need the following information to determine your threshold amount:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Total taxable sales and revenue for your immediately preceding fiscal year. Do not include amounts collected as GST/HST or provincial sales tax.</li>
  <li> The total of your taxable sales and revenue that was derived from:
    <ul>
      <li>goodwill;</li>
      <li>financial services;</li>
      <li>sales of capital real property;</li>
      <li>zero-rated exports; and</li>
      <li>supplies made outside Canada.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Threshold amount = ((Total taxable sales and revenue - Total taxable sales and revenue derived from the items listed above) / Total number of days in the fiscal year) x 365</p>
<p>If you have divisions or associates, complete the above calculation for each division or associate. The total threshold amount equals the sum of all the threshold amounts for each associate, as well as the threshold amount for the account filing the election.</p>
<h4 id="dt20">Effective date</h4>
<p>The effective date must be the first day of your fiscal year.</p>
<p>Your election will not be accepted if you have already filed GST/HST returns for the fiscal period. For example, if you file your election on March 1, 2021 with an effective date of January 1, 2021, and you have already filed your January 2021 GST/HST return, we will not accept your election.</p>
<h4>Due date for filing your election</h4>
<p>If you are electing to change from quarterly to annual filing, file your election no later than three months after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the election is to take effect.</p>
<p>If you are a new registrant, make an election to change your reporting period on or before the effective date of your GST/HST registration when the election is to take effect on that day.</p>
<p>In all other cases, file your election no later than two months after the day the election is to take effect.</p>
<h3 id="gst20fi">Change your reporting period &ndash; for
  <mark>LFIs</mark>
  (GST20-1 or RC7220-1)</h3>
<p>Use the following forms if you are an
  <mark>LFI</mark>
  and want to revoke a previous election made under section 246 or 247 of the <em>Excise Tax Act</em> to change the reporting period of your GST/HST return:</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="gst20rev">Effective date</h4>
<p>The revocation effective date must be the first day of your fiscal year, and cannot be earlier than today’s date.</p>
<h3 id="h_2_3">Change a fiscal year (GST70 or RC7270)</h3>
<p>Use the following forms to file an election to change your GST/HST fiscal year, or to revoke a previously filed election:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst70.html">GST70, Election or Revocation of an Election to Change a GST/HST Fiscal Year </a></li>

</ul>
<p>If you are an individual or a trust, you can make your fiscal year end something other than a calendar year end if you have chosen for income tax purposes to use a fiscal period that is not the same as your tax year for one or more of your businesses (or a partnership of which you are a member).</p>
<p>If you are not an individual or trust, you can change your GST/HST fiscal year to be either: (i) the same as your tax year for income purposes, or, (ii) December 31st.</p>
<h4 id="dt70">Effective date</h4>
<p>The effective date must be the first day of the new fiscal period. For example, if your new GST/HST fiscal year end is June 30 (06-30) and you want the election to be effective <span class="nowrap">for 2018</span>, then the effective date must be <span class="nowrap">July 1, 2018</span>.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Notify us of varying accounting periods (GST71 or RC7271)</h3>
<p>Use the following forms if your accounting periods vary in length throughout your fiscal year, or if your quarter-end and month-end dates do not end on the last day of a calendar month:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst71.html">GST71, Notification of GST/HST Accounting Periods</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Your accounting periods have to meet our guidelines for fiscal quarters and months.</p>
<h4 id="fq71">Fiscal quarters</h4>
<p>There are four fiscal quarters in each fiscal year. The first fiscal quarter in a fiscal year starts on the first day of that fiscal year, and the last fiscal quarter ends on the last day of that fiscal year. Each fiscal quarter cannot be longer than 119 days and, except for the first and last quarters of the fiscal year, each fiscal quarter cannot be shorter than 84 days.</p>
<h4 id="m71">Fiscal months</h4>
<p>The first fiscal month in each fiscal quarter starts on the first day of the fiscal quarter, and the last fiscal month in each fiscal quarter ends on the last day of that fiscal quarter. Each fiscal month cannot be longer than 35 days and, except for the first and last month of a fiscal quarter, each fiscal month cannot be shorter than 28 days.</p>
<h3 id="GST74">Start or stop using the quick method of accounting (GST74)</h3>
<p>Use the following form to start or stop using the quick method of accounting:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/gst74.html">GST74, Election and Revocation of an Election to Use the Quick Method of Accounting</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Effective date</h4>
<p>When electing to use the quick method of accounting, the effective date has to be the first day of a GST/HST reporting period. If you had previously elected to use the quick method and had revoked that election, you have to wait at least one year from the date the revocation became effective before you can elect to use the quick method again.</p>
<h4>When and how can you revoke the election?</h4>
<p>You can revoke the election only after your quick method election has been in effect for at least one year. Generally, you have to revoke the election by the due date of the GST/HST return for the last reporting period in which you wish to use the quick method.</p>

<h4 id="prtA">Part A – Identification</h4>
<p>Enter the Business Number of each specified member and specify whether the account is a qualifying or temporary member. Also enter the reporting period of the return that includes the effective date of the election or revocation. For example, if the effective date is <span class="nowrap">January 15, 2016</span> and the member is a monthly filer with a calendar year end, the reporting period would be <span class="nowrap">January 1, 2016</span> to <span class="nowrap">January 31, 2016</span>.</p>
<h4 id="prtB">Part B – Election or revocation of the election</h4>
<p>To make (or revoke) the election, you have to complete parts A and B of the RC4616 form and file it on or before the day which the GST/HST return for the reporting period that includes the effective date of the election is required to be filed. The election is to be filed by the earliest date that a GST/HST return is due from the specified members who intend to make the election.</p>
<h3 id="h_2_7">Treat certain taxable supplies as made for nil consideration for GST/HST or QST purposes &ndash; for SLFIs (RC7296)</h3>
<p>Corporations and partnerships that are specified members of a qualifying group that includes an SLFI for GST/HST and QST purposes or an SLFI only for QST purposes can use the RC7296 form to either jointly make or revoke the elections with another specified member of the group to treat certain taxable supplies made between them as having been made for no consideration for GST/HST or QST purposes or for both GST/HST and QST purposes:</p>
