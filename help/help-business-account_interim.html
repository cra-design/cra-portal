    <p>The overview page primarily enables you to access instances of <strong>program account types</strong> (such as GST/HST, payroll or corporation income tax, etc.) associated with every Business Number (BN) added to My Business Account. Outstanding returns and payments are highlighted for your quick reference. You can also view the status of any in-progess or recently completed submitions in the progress tracker.</p>

    <p>The legal name registered on your BN registration records and the nine-digit BN are both displayed at the top-right corner of the overview page. For example:</p>

    <p>Your BN is also displayed at the top of the left-menu in the <strong>Business</strong> <span class="nowrap"><strong>number (BN)</strong></span> drop-down.</p>
    <h2 id="h_2">If you have more than one business</h2>
    <p>If you have more than one BN added to your account, you can select another BN from the drop-down options at the top of the left menu.</p>
    <p>You can add BNs or choose which BN is displayed by default from the <strong>Profile</strong> page you can find in the left menu. For more details, refer to the help page <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/cra-portal/help/about-your-profile.html">About your profile</a>.</p>

    <h3>Left menu</h3>
    <p>In the left menu, all program account types associated with your BN are listed. Each one expands to list instances of this program account type. For example, RT0001 for your GST/HST account.</p>
    <p>Select the expanded instances to view more information.</p>
    <h2 id="h_4">If you have multiples of a program account type</h2>
    <p>In the left menu, you will find all your program account types in drop-down list. When you expand one, all instances of this program account type are displayed where you can select which one you want to view or action:</p>
    <p>For example, if your business has two GST/HST accounts:</p>
    <ul class="list-unstyled">
      <li>GST/HST <span class="small"><span class="small mrgn-lft-xl glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down" aria-hidden="true"></span></span>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li>RT0001</li>
          <li>RT0002</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Select either one to display the information associated with that account in My Business Account.</p>
