    <h3 id="h_1">When you have more than one business</h3>
    <p>After you have entered one or more nine-digit Business Numbers (BN) into the Manage my profile page, they will be available in the drop-down box on the Welcome page. This will allow you to select the BN you want to transact for.</p>
    <p><strong>The account information available from the Welcome page will correspond to the BN you select.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, you have two businesses that each have a payroll account. If you select the BN for your first business, you will be able to see the payroll information for that business by selecting any of the services available under the Payroll heading. If you select the BN for the second business, all the payroll information available will apply to the second business.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you remove all the BNs from the Manage my profile page, a BN will no longer appear on the Welcome page and no services will be available. To regain these services, you will need to add a Business Number by selecting the Manage my profile link.</p>
    <h3 id="h_2">Choosing a default Business Number</h3>
    <p>If you have more than one business, choose the one that you will want to view most often.</p>
