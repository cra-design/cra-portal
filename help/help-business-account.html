    <h2 id="h_1">Checking your business name and Business Number (BN)</h2>
    <p>The legal name registered on your BN registration records and the nine-digit BN are both displayed at the top-right corner of the overview page.</p>
    <p>Your BN is also displayed at the top of the left-menu in the <span class="nowrap"><strong>Business number (BN)</strong></span> drop-down.</p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <div class="panel panel-default">
          <div class="panel-body">
            <p><strong>Sample information in the top-right corner:</strong></p>
            <p>ABC Industries Inc.<br />
              123456789</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>If you have more than one BN added to your account, you can select another BN from the drop-down options at the top of the left menu.</p>
    <p>You can add BNs or choose which BN is displayed by default by selecting <strong>Manage business number(s)</strong> from the Profile page.</p>
    <h2 id="h_3">Which types of business accounts appear on My Business Account?</h2>
    <p>All accounts associated with the Business Number will appear on the Welcome page for My Business Account. My Business Account displays <strong>only</strong> the following types of accounts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GST/HST</li>
      <li>Payroll</li>
      <li>Corporation tax</li>
      <li>Excise duty</li>
      <li>Excise tax</li>
      <li>Excise tax on insurance premiums</li>
      <li>Air Travellers Security Charge</li>
      <li>Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="h_4">What if I have more than one business?</h2>
    <p>You can add another nine-digit Business Number (BN) into My Business Account using the "Manage my profile" link from the Business Profile menu. You can also change the default BN that appears when you log in from this page. The Manage my profile page lets you select which BN automatically appears when you log in to My Business Account.</p>
    <h2 id="h_5">How do I get information about a specific account if my business has more than one GST/HST (or payroll, corporation tax, etc.) account?</h2>
    <p>Under each account heading, you will see your BN with a drop-down box beside it where you can select which one you want to transact for. For example, your business has two GST/HST accounts:<br />
      <br />
      12345 6789 RT <strong>0001</strong> (first GST/HST account) <br />
      <br />
      12345 6789 RT <strong>0002</strong> (second GST/HST account)</p>
    <p>If you select the second account (0002), the information available on My Business Account will be for the second GST/HST account. If you select 0001, the information will change to the first GST/HST account.</p>
    <p>You can get account information the same way for payroll and corporation accounts.</p>
    <p>To get information about a specific account under the "Other accounts" heading, first select the type of account you want (for example, the "Excise duty" link). A new page with a list of services and a drop-down box next to the excise duty account number will be displayed.</p>
