</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="help2a">1. What is the nine-digit number listed at the top of the Welcome page for My Business Account?</h3>
    <p>This nine-digit number is the Business Number that identifies your business. If your business has more than one type of account, the same nine numbers will start each account number.</p>
    <p>Sample:<br /><br /><strong>12345 6789</strong> RT 0001 (GST/HST)<br /><br /><strong>12345 6789</strong> RP 0001 (Payroll)</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="help2b">2. What business name is displayed on My Business Account?</h3>
    <p>The legal name registered on your BN registration records is displayed on the My Business Account Welcome page.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="help2c">3. Which types of business accounts appear on My Business Account?</h3>
    <p>All accounts associated with the Business Number will appear on the Welcome page for My Business Account. My Business Account displays <strong>only</strong> the following types of accounts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>GST/HST</li>
        <li>Payroll</li>
        <li>Corporation tax</li>
        <li>Excise duty</li>
        <li>Excise tax</li>
        <li>Excise tax on insurance premiums</li>
        <li>Air Travellers Security Charge</li>
        <li>Softwood Lumber Products Export Charge</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="help2d">4. What if I have more than one business?</h3>
    <p>You can add another nine-digit Business Number (BN) into My Business Account using the "Manage my profile" link from the Business Profile menu. You can also change the default BN that appears when you log in from this page. The Manage my profile page lets you select which BN automatically appears when you log in to My Business Account.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="help2e">5. How do I get information about a specific account if my business has more than one GST/HST (or payroll, corporation tax, etc.) account?</h3>
    <p>Under each account heading, you will see your BN with a drop-down box beside it where you can select which one you want to transact for. For example, your business has two GST/HST accounts:</p>
    12345 6789 RT <strong>0001</strong> (first GST/HST account) <br /><br />
    12345 6789 RT <strong>0002</strong> (second GST/HST account)
    <p>If you select the second account (0002), the information available on My Business Account will be for the second GST/HST account. If you select 0001, the information will change to the first GST/HST account.</p>
    <p>You can get account information the same way for payroll and corporation accounts.</p>
    <p>To get information about a specific account under the "Other accounts" heading, first select the type of account you want (for example, the "Excise duty" link). A new page with a list of services and a drop-down box next to the excise duty account number will be displayed.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="help2f">6. How do I return to the Welcome page for My Business Account to select another account and service?</h3>
    <p>From any service, you can return to the Welcome page by selecting the "My Business Account" link on the left side bar of each page.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2>Using the Manage my profile page</h2>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="help2g">1. What can I do if I have more than one business?</h3>
    <p>After you have entered one or more nine-digit Business Numbers (BN) into the Manage my profile page, they will be available in the drop-down box on the Welcome page. This will allow you to select the BN you want to transact for.</p>
    <p><strong>The account information available from the Welcome page will correspond to the BN you select.</strong></p>
    <p>For example, you have two businesses that each have a payroll account. If you select the BN for your first business, you will be able to see the payroll information for that business by selecting any of the services available under the Payroll heading. If you select the BN for the second business, all the payroll information available will apply to the second business.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you remove all the BNs from the Manage my profile page, a BN will no longer appear on the Welcome page and no services will be available. To regain these services, you will need to add a Business Number by selecting the Manage my profile link.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h3 id="help2h">2. Which Business Number should I choose as a default?</h3>
    <p>If you have more than one business, choose the one that you will want to view most often.</p>
</div>
