  <li>Form GST106, Information on claims paid or credited for foreign conventions and tour packages</li>

<h2 id="h_1">When to select GST34</h2>
<p>Selecting Form GST34, <em>Goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) return</em> for registrants allows you to file your GST34 return along with any applicable schedules and rebates.</p>
<p>Using this option, you can also file Form GST106,â€¯<em>Information on claims paid or credited for foreign conventions and tour packages</em>, along with your return.</p>
<h2 id="h_2">When to select GST106</h2>
<p>Select Form GST106, <em>Information on claims paid or credited for foreign conventions and tour packages</em> if you <strong>do not</strong> want to file Forms GST106 and GST34 at the same time.</p>
<p>If you want to file both forms at the same time, select the GST34 option instead.</p>
<p>If you paid or credited rebate amounts for foreign conventions or tour packages, and you claimed a deduction on your GST/HST return for the amount of GST/HST you paid or credited, then you must file this form. File this return for each reporting period in which you paid or credited these amounts and claimed a deduction on your GST/HST return.</p>
<h2 id="h_3">When to select RC7200</h2>
<p>Form RC7200, <em>Goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) and Quebec sales tax (QST) return for selected listed financial institutions</em> is a combined return that is used by registrants that are selected listed financial institutions (SLFIs) with a permanent establishment in Quebec. These include listed financial institutions that would only be an SLFI for GST/HST purposes if Quebec were a participating province, and who have monthly or quarterly reporting requirements. For the definitions of SLFI for GST/HST purposes and SLFI for QST purposes, see Guide RC7250, <em>GST/HST and QST Information for Selected Listed Financial Institutions</em>.</p>
<p>Do not use this form if you are an SLFI for GST/HST purposes that does not have a permanent establishment in Quebec. Instead, use Form GST34, <em>Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</em>.</p>
