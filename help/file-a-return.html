    <p>The "File a return" web form in My Business Account allows you to choose from 3 types of GST/HST and Quebec sales tax (QST) returns to file. The GST34 option allows you file both GST34 and GST106 returns at the same time. The RC7200 option allows you to file GST/HST and QST returns together. </p>

    <h2 id="h_1">When to select GST34</h2>
    <p>Selecting Form GST34, <em>Goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) return for registrants</em> allows you to file your GST34 return along with any applicable schedules and rebates.</p>
    <p>Using this option, you can also file Form GST106, <em>Information on claims paid or credited for foreign conventions</em>, along with your return.</p>
    <p>For information on how to enter your information, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account/gst-hst-electronic-filing.html">Completing a GST/HST return in My Business Account</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="h_2">When to select GST106</h2>
    <p>Select Form GST106, <em>Information on claims paid or credited for foreign conventions</em> if you <strong>do not</strong> want to file Forms GST106 and GST34 at the same time.</p>
    <p>If you want to file both forms at the same time, select the GST34 option instead.</p>
    <p>If you paid or credited rebate amounts for foreign conventions, and you claimed a deduction on your GST/HST return for the amount of GST/HST you paid or credited, then you must file this form. File this return for each reporting period in which you paid or credited these amounts and claimed a deduction on your GST/HST return.</p>
    <p>For more information, refer to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/digital-services-businesses/business-account/file-a-gst106.html">Completing a GST106 return in My Business Account</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="h_3">When to select RC7200</h2>
    <p>Form RC7200, <em>Goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) and Quebec sales tax (QST) return for selected listed financial institutions</em> is a combined return that is used by registrants that are selected listed financial institutions (SLFIs) with a permanent establishment in Quebec. These include listed financial institutions (LFIs) that would only be an SLFI for GST/HST purposes if Quebec were a participating province, and who have monthly or quarterly reporting requirements.</p>
    <p>Do not use this form if you are an SLFI for GST/HST purposes that does not have a permanent establishment in Quebec. Instead, use Form GST34, <em>Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</em>.</p>
