    <p>The "File a return" service allows you to electronically file the GST/HST returns listed below. On the selection page, select the return type you want to file and click «Next» to access the online web form.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2>Goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) return for registrants (Form GST34)</h2>
    <p>This option allows you to file your GST34 return along with any applicable schedules and rebates. You can also file Form GST106, <em>Information on claims paid or credited for foreign conventions and tour packages</em>, along with your return.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2>Information on claims paid or credited for foreign conventions and tour packages (Form GST106)</h2>
    <p>If you paid or credited rebate amounts for foreign conventions or tour packages, and you claimed a deduction on your GST/HST return for the amount of GST/HST you paid or credited, then you must file this form. You have to file this form for each reporting period in which you paid or credited these amounts and claimed a deduction on your GST/HST return.</p>
    <p>Use this option if you do not want to file Forms GST106 and GST34 at the same time. If you want to file both forms at the same time, select the GST34 option instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="mwsbodytext text parbase section">
    <h2>Goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) and Quebec sales tax (QST) return for selected listed financial institutions (Form RC7200)</h2>
    <p>This form is a combined return that is used by registrants that are selected listed financial institutions (SLFIs) with a permanent establishment in Quebec, including listed financial institutions that would only be an SLFI for GST/HST purposes if Quebec were a participating province, and who have monthly or quarterly reporting requirements. For the definitions of SLFI for GST/HST purposes and SLFI for QST purposes, see Guide RC7250, <em>GST/HST and QST Information for Selected Listed Financial Institutions</em>.</p>
    <p>Do not use this form if you are an SLFI for GST/HST purposes that does not have a permanent establishment in Quebec. Instead, use Form GST34, <em>Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) Return for Registrants</em>.</p>
